# clear_tag

Step 1:

You will need to setup a service account in ePO with the appropriate permissions to perform these actions. I do not recommend using an administrator account. Setup an account with only the required permissions.


Step 2:

Change the variables epo, epo_port, svc_user, svc_password to reflect your environment setup.


Step 3:

Change tag to the exact name of the tag you wish to clear.


Step 4:

Deploy.
